Image Striper
=============

This is a simple script, made as an exercise, to try to emulate the effect
seen in [this video](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhZU4XMgdYA/).

Since it is my first real attempt with Python, don't expect too much of it.
There are some little perks, but it works. You can see some
[examples here](https://imgur.com/a/2Dmct).

## To do:

* Trim the image to get rid of the white lines;
* Maybe ask for the stripe width as a third argument;
* Rewrite it to avoid repetition and to be a little more pythonesque ;-).

## Disclaimer

Feel free to do whatever the fuck you want with it.
